        <h3>How the escrow works?</h3>
        <p>
          All listings with a price higher than 0 will need to create an escrow.
          This means the buyer will need to call a smart contract with metamask.
          After this is done, the page will redirect to the escrow page. After
          signing the escrow terms and conditions, the buyer will need to
          deposit payment into the escrow.
        </p>
        <h5>What are the escrow states?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Awaiting Payment : It means the buyer didn't deposit anything,yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Awaiting Delivery : This state means the buyer payed and the seller
            needs to ship the product
          </li>
          <li>
            Delivered : If the package has been delivered, the buyer needs to
            change the escrow state to delivered. This means the seller can pull
            payments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refunded : If there was a dispute or the seller decided to refund
            the order, he can do so and in this state the buyer can pull his
            refund.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How orders work?</h3>
        <p>
          Orders are created when somebody clicks the buy button on a device
          listing page. You can find your orders on the
          <a href="/orders">/orders</a> page. Orders can have an escrow or they
          are free.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h5>What are the order states?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pending : All the orders created are pending. The seller needs to
            either ship or reject the order.
          </li>
          <li>Shipped : The order can be marked shipped.</li>
          <li>Rejected : The order can be rejected by the seller.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Good to know: The escrow and the order states are separate. When
          shipping products, make sure you use the two together. Only ship after
          payment has been deposited!

        <h3>How does dispute resolution work?</h3>
        <p>
          Each order has a dispute button. Press this if your order has has not
          arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          The escrow agent can resolve disputes involving the escrow payments.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The escrow can be set to delivered so the seller can pull payments.
          </li>
          <li>The escrow can be refunded to the buyer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This app is not on mainnet, we give no warranty of any kind. Untill we
          arrive on mainnet, the dispute resolution may not function.
